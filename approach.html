            <h2>1. Idea</h2><br>
            <p>Digital victories start with ideas. We help you formulate your thoughts into a winning digital model. That includes having a full array of brain power at your disposal to work out every aspect of your idea. During the Idea phase, we:
                <br><br>✓ Engage our CTO and development team to understand what technology works best, what are all the programming languages that apply and formulate the initial design thinking;
                <br><br>✓ Deploy our digital consulting knowledge to understand what works best for the customer and what are the applicable cutting-edge technologies;
                <br><br>✓ Work with you to clearly define the idea, the business model and advise you how to enhance it.</p>

            <h2>2. Plan</h2><br>
            <p>Ideas and projects need plans for execution. We base our<br> working processes on clear plans for execution of the project.

                <br><br>✓ Defining a budget for the project
                <br><br>✓ Writing a clear specification of design and user interface features which forms a basis for everything we do later
                <br><br>✓ Specifying technologies, programming languages, licences and the end product
                <br><br>✓ Applying agile methodology and defining sprints, deadlines and key project milestones
                <br><br>✓ Outlining our iterations and mutual mode of operations, including your and our project leads</p>

            <h2>3. Design</h2><br>
            <p>The most important part of any development project is<br>information architecture and user experience design. The<br> design stage typically involves moving the information outlined<br> in the planning stage further into reality. The main deliverables<br> are a documented site structure and, more importantly, a visual<br> representation.
                <br><br> Our design process includes:
                 <br><br>✓ Wireframe and design elements planning
                 <br><br>✓ Mock-ups based on requirements analysis
                 <br><br>✓ Review and approval cycle
                 <br><br>✓ Slice and code valid HTML/CSS</p>

            <h2>4. Development</h2><br>
            <p>Development involves the bulk of the programming work, as<br> well as loading content. We keep code organized and <br>commented, and refer constantly to the planning details as the<br> full website takes shape. Also we take a strategic approach, and<br> avoid future hassles by constantly testing as we develop.

                <br><br>Our development process includes:
                 <br><br>✓ Choosing the development framework
                 <br><br>✓ Selecting code templates for each page type
                 <br><br>✓ Development and testing of special features and interactivity
                 <br><br>✓ Testing and verification of links and functionality</p>

            <h2>5. Launch</h2><br>
            <p>The purpose of the launch phase is to prepare the project for<br> public viewing. This requires final polishing of design elements,<br> deep testing of interactivity and features and, most of all, a<br> consideration of the user experience. An important early step in<br> this phase is to move the project, if need be, to its permanent<br> server.
                 <br><br>✓ Transfer to live server
                 <br><br>✓ Final cross-browser check
                 <br><br>✓ Hand off to client
                 <br><br>✓ Provision documentation and source files
                <br><br>✓ Project closure, final documentation</p>
